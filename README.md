# BlockscanID Token (BID)

> 🧪 Experimental prototype for identity-token UX design in the Blockscan ecosystem.

---

## 🔍 Overview

**BlockscanID Token (BID)** is a functional proof-of-concept for identity-layer UX using ENS, wallet binding, and token-based claims — built around the reserved ENS domain `blockscanid.eth`.

This project is **not affiliated** with Blockscan, Etherscan, or any official entity.  
It exists to demonstrate possibilities for secure identity anchoring and wallet-based interactions via ENS infrastructure.

---

## 💡 Potential Use Cases

- **Verified Wallet ID Binding**  
  Link wallets to sub-identities like `user.blockscanid.eth` to enable recognizability across apps.

- **ENS-integrated Session Tokens**  
  Use for ephemeral or delegated identities within dapps using Etherscan APIs.

- **Credential Anchoring & ZK**  
  Provide a foundation for future credentials or attestations (ZK or signature-based).
