# blockscanid.eth - ENS-linked Identity Prototype

This is a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a decentralized identity interface using `blockscanid.eth`,  
demonstrating how ENS domains can be used in wallet-based identity flows — particularly in systems like Blockscan Chat or EVM-compatible messaging platforms.

> ⚠️ This project is a non-affiliated prototype.  
> It is **not** officially associated with Blockscan, Etherscan, or any related entity.
