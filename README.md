# BlockscanID Token (BID)

> 🧪 A functional prototype for identity-token UX exploration in the Blockscan ecosystem.

---

## 🔍 Overview

**BlockscanID Token (BID)** is a non-official, experimental ERC-20 token designed to explore user identity mapping, wallet binding, and ENS resolution mechanics within the Blockscan ecosystem.

This prototype is intended as a proof-of-concept (PoC) and showcases a basic UI + token + ENS setup that simulates how an identity layer might work on L2 networks powered by Blockscan tools.

## 💡 Potential Use Cases

1. **Verified Account Linking**  
   Associate a user's wallet address with a specific ENS-based ID (e.g., `alice.blockscanid.eth`).

2. **On-Chain Attestation Anchor**  
   Use the token as a mock anchor for zero-knowledge attestation, future credentials, or account recovery.

3. **ENS-Integrated Wallet UI**  
   Offer wallet-based login & token claim UX that feels intuitive, fast, and verifiable across apps.

4. **Delegation or Session Identity Tokens**  
   Enable temporary or delegated identities for specific use-cases in dapps that integrate Blockscan or Etherscan APIs.
